# jotBYTES API Server

jotBYTES API Server is a lightweight, efficient note-taking API built with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) and MongoDB. It provides a simple yet powerful way to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes, leveraging the speed of Go and the flexibility of MongoDB for storage.

Ideally, this will turn into a fun open-source project that will help me learn more about Go, Fiber, and MongoDB, and also provide a useful tool for myself and others to use.

Still getting this repo setup, so stay tuned for more updates! And I will open the discussions and issues sections for feature requests and bug reports soon.

## The Vision

The jotBYTES API Server is designed to be a simple, fast, and secure way to manage notes. It is built with the following goals in mind: simplicity, speed, and security. This is the backend of the jotBYTES cli tool, which will be a simple, fast, and secure way to manage notes from the command line.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for notes.
- Basic authentication for secure note operations.
- Fast and scalable, built on top of Fiber.
- Uses MongoDB for noSQL storage, offering flexibility in note schema.
